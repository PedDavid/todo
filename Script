Let's start programming!

This project will target the JVM, the reason for that is not "it's better" or anything along those lines.
I have a lot of languages that I want to try, features I want to explore...
That said I will explore them in this simple project anyway so I will choose an environment I'm more comfortable with to start the project.

You can use any IDE or Text Editor you want, I will be using IntelliJ IDEA.
Exactly because every person has a preference about the editor I don't want the project to be tied with any IDE or Text Editor.
Because of that I will be using the Gradle Build Tool to build, test, automate all project tasks.

Set Up the project:

Create Project Folder (mkdir && cd)
Init Gradle Project   (gradle init (--type java-application))
    java-application will create the project folder structure, that's all I want from that switch
Small Touch Ups
    Change Project to Kotlin


Version Control       (git init, create .gitignore, git hooks)
